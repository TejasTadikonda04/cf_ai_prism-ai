# Description: 

All AI prompts I wrote to assist with building this project are shown below. I used Gemini 3 Pro to help with planning & broad overview tasks, and used Claude Sonnet 4.5 as an Agent through Cursor for code assistance. 

# Prompts: 

I am working on building a type of AI-powered application on Cloudflare. It will use an LLM, workflow/coordination, user input via chat or voice, and memory or state. I want you to help me brainstorm some potential application ideas.

A good AI-powered application is:

1. Innovative. I don't want to do something that has been done many times before. I want to create an applicatoin that is innovative in some way.

2. Useful. I want it to provide some sort of value to the user and not simply be for demonstration purposes.

Brainstorm 5-10 ideas of potential AI-powered applications and write a concise paragraph detailing each one.
